🫀 Cardiovascular Disease Detection
This project aims to detect the likelihood of cardiovascular disease in a patient using machine learning models based on medical and lifestyle attributes. 
It provides a streamlined pipeline for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction through an interactive web interface.

📌 Features
✅ Data preprocessing and feature scaling

✅ Multiple ML model support (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)

✅ Model evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC

✅ Streamlit/FastAPI web interface for real-time prediction

✅ Clean and modular codebase


🧠 Technologies Used
Python 3.x

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn, XGBoost

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Streamlit / FastAPI

Jupyter Notebook / VSCode


📊 Dataset
The dataset contains patient health metrics like:

Age

Gender

Blood pressure (systolic/diastolic)

Cholesterol and glucose levels

Smoking, alcohol intake, physical activity

Body Mass Index (BMI)

Target: Presence of cardiovascular disease
