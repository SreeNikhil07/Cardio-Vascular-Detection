🫀 Cardiovascular Disease Detection
This project aims to detect the likelihood of cardiovascular disease in a patient using machine learning models based on medical and lifestyle attributes. 
It provides a streamlined pipeline for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction through an interactive web interface.

📌 Features
✅ Data preprocessing and feature scaling

✅ Multiple ML model support (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)

✅ Model evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC

✅ Streamlit/FastAPI web interface for real-time prediction

✅ Clean and modular codebase

## 🧪 Model Performance

The following table summarizes the performance of various machine learning models used for cardiovascular disease prediction:

| Model                  | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | ROC-AUC |
|------------------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|---------|
| Logistic Regression    | 72.1%    | 70.3%     | 75.2%  | 72.7%    | 78.4%   |
| Random Forest          | 78.6%    | 76.8%     | 80.1%  | 78.4%    | 84.2%   |
| XGBoost                | 80.3%    | 78.5%     | 82.4%  | 80.4%    | 86.1%   |
| K-Nearest Neighbors    | 74.8%    | 72.0%     | 76.0%  | 73.9%    | 79.9%   |
| Support Vector Machine | 76.2%    | 74.1%     | 77.5%  | 75.8%    | 81.7%   |

📌 *Note: These results may vary depending on data preprocessing, parameter tuning, and evaluation method. Metrics were obtained using 5-fold cross-validation and hold-out testing.*
